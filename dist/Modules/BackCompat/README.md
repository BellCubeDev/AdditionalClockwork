# Backwards Compatibility Folder

This folder holds legacy modules that were either removed or later merged into other modules that contain scripted objects. Because of how scripted objects are handled in Skyrim save files, you have two options when you previously installed a removed module:

- Clean the Unattached Instances from your save with [FallrimTools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031)
- Install the redundant module alongside the new itteration

Now, I will say that these Unattached Instances *should* be completely harmless, but I wouldn't risk your save.
