# Woodworker's Whim

Woodworker's Whim's script probably needs re-written. On well.

## Modules

Woodworker's Whim (or WoodWhim for short) allows the player to grab a nearby axe when chopping wood without one. Installing both won't cause any major conflict, but also won't do anything for you.

* Global Module - Allows you to borrow a nearby axe whenever you chop wood. It is not considered theft because you're putting it right back.
* Work Room Module - Only lets you do the above in the Work Room. My personal preference.

### Axe Mount

Because I'm nice, I also gave you an axe mount that uses Clockwork's already-established display system. Because the item is physically in the world, it works quite well with either of the other modules.
