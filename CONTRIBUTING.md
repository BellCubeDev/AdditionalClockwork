# Contributing to Additional Clockwork

I'm always open to contributions—from a simple typo fix to an idea suggestion to an entire re-format of the mod, I'm open to just about anything! But first, you have to convince me that your change is a good idea. That's what this document is for!

## [Tell Me What You Want (Issues)](https://github.com/BellCubeDev/AdditionalClockwork/issues/new/choose)

Issues are the easiest way for you to contribute (well, easy for *you*, anyway). Issues are an easy way for me to track your problem or suggestion—and a good way to keep me on track. I have multiple templates ready for use, should you have an issue to report or a suggestion to file. Here are some general-purpose guidelines:
* To-the-point: While I'd love to read your whole life's story, that time would be much better spent working on this mod, wouldn't you say?
* Anything goes! If you suggest it, I'll read it. If I disagree with your idea, I'll write an essay explaining *why*.
* Keep it lore-friendly. If you don't think it fits into Clockwork's lore, it probably doesn't. If you're on the fence, submit the issue anyway! I may interpret it as lore-friendly and add it anyway.
* Manage your expectations. I'm not rebuilding the entire castle, for instance. I've served my time making Interesting Inhabitants (*that took forever!*). If you want a massive module, expect a good bit of waiting.
* Keep it SFW. 

## [Direct Contributions (Pull Requests)](https://github.com/BellCubeDev/AdditionalClockwork/compare)

Pull Requests are bound by all of the Issue guidelines, with some specialized ones on top.
Do note that, because Additional Clockwork is a Skyrim: Special Edition (SSE) mod, very little of this repository can be edited without a copy of the game.

### Plugins

Requires SSE<br>
Plugins are the Creation Engine's way of storing data. Plugins, formatted in Records, can be manipulated primarily in 2 programs: the [Creation Kit](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Creation_Kit), which gives you a visual editor, and [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164), a tool for viewing individual edits as text. Both tools are highly recommended.

### Papyrus

Requires SSE<br>
Papyrus is a programming language, somewhat similar to Python, that is used by the Creation Engine, allowing authors to easily script certain aspects of the game. Some things to keep in mind when contributing to Papyrus scripts:
* All of your changes will be released into the Public Domain
* You should test your changes before committing them to your fork

### FOMOD

The FOMOD can be edited without a copy of the game. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to edit it. Encoded in [the bundled workspace file](Additional%20Clockwork.code-workspace), I have plugin recommendations that may be helpful to those wishing to edit the FOMOD.

### Images

This section depends almost entirely on what you plan to do. You may need SSE, you may not. You may need Photoshop, or perhaps you could use GIMP. There are, however, some hard requirements:
* You must attach the raw images—ideally in the editor file (for example, a hidden or layer in a .PSD, or Photoshop Document file)
* If applicable, you must attach editor files. This makes it possible for me—and other contributors—to tweak (or even recreate) your image.

### GitHub Repository

There are no real limits as to what you can contribute to make my life managing this repo easier. Just use common sense.
