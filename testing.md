## **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

*These modules will NOT—**UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**—be final, polished, or even safe to use. You have been warned. I am not responsible or liable in ANY WAY WHATSOEVER for any negative impact \(including save save corruption\) that comes from the use of unreleased modules.*

## I've read that. What next?

1) Go to the branch you want \(e.g. [1.1.0](https://github.com/BellCubeDev/AdditionalClockwork/tree/1.1.0)\).
2) Download the code as a zip.

### If using a mod manager

3) Extract the zip to any **empty** folder you want.
4) Zip the contents of the [`dist\`](dist) folder. Name it whatever you want (idealy something lie `AttitionalClockwork-Test-v.1.0.zip`)
5) Install with your favorite mod manager

### If installing manually

3) Extract the mod as you would any other mod
