[size=6][b]Modules
[color=#6d9eeb]Courier Counterspell[/color][/b][/size][size=1] (Banner scrapped, I'm merging this module into another. I hoped to make a gigantic jab at [url=https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2148]this MTG card[/url])[/size]
[size=3]Uses a script to disable World Interaction events (aka Random Encounters) when at Clockwork Castle, which primarily [b][u]fixes the courier issue[/u][/b]. No more monomaniacal correspondence-wizard. Rain or shine, GET OFF MY LAWN![/size]

[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BellCubeDev/AdditionalClockwork/latest/Images/ShadowmarksBanner.png[/img]
[size=4]Made of three modules, which each add "Guild" (Member) shadowmarks to these locations:
[/size][list]
[size=4][*][color=#ffd966]The Castle's front door[/color]
[*][color=#6d9eeb]The Travel Room's door to the Main Hall[/color]
[*][color=#93c47d]Each of the Terminus locations[/color] (two in Riften, one everywhere else)
[/size][/list]
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BellCubeDev/AdditionalClockwork/latest/Images/WoodworkersWhim.png[/img]
[size=4]Adds two things: An Axe Mount to the Work Room and a script that searches for dropped/mounted axes nearby for you to chop wood with.

Really made up of three modules:
[list]
[*][color=#ffd966]The script enabled [b]globally[/b][/color][b] (does [u]NOT[/u] require Clockwork)[/b]
[*][color=#6d9eeb]The script enabled [b]ONLY in the Work Room[/b][/color] ([b][u]redundant[/u][/b] if the Global module is enabled)
[*][color=#93c47d]An Axe mount for the Work Room[/color]
[/list][/size]
[size=6][b]Minor Tweaks & Changes[/b][/size]
[size=2]Now with even less impact on gameplay![/size][list]
[*][b][size=4][color=#6aa84f]Mausoleum Dummy Dor Fix[/color] - [/size][/b]When leaving Nurndural for the first time, there is a scene that plays with Lamashtu and Shadow. While the scene plays out, you are prevented from leaving by a fake door. However, this fake door, when disappears, is EXTREMELY NOTICEABLE if you look at the door. Of course, I had to fix this. My efficient brethren, you can rest easy now.
[*][b][size=4][color=#6aa84f]Clockwork Title Remover[/color] - [/size][/b]Removes the giant floating Clockwork title that appears when you first enter the Castle's valley [b]([url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=10280988/#entry97162223]idea[/url] by [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/42417205-foamimi/]Foamimi[/url])[/b].
[/list]

[size=6][b]Integration, Patches, and Consistency
[/b][/size]You know. Standard patches etc.
[color=#ffd966][size=4][b]High Poly Project[/b]
[/size][/color][list][*][b][color=#6aa84f][size=4]Coals Fix:[/size][/color][/b][size=4] Uses High Poly Project's mesh for the coals instead of the vanilla mesh.[/size][size=2] (needs new game) (See project images)[/size]
[*][size=4][b][color=#6aa84f]Hay Fix:[/color][/b] Fixes the hay [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Z-fighting&oldid=1031681976#:~:text=z-fighting%2C%20also%20called%20stitching%20or%20planefighting%2C%20is%20a%20phenomenon%20in%203d%20rendering%20that%20occurs%20when%20two%20or%20more%20primitives%20have%20very%20similar%20distances%20to%20the%20camera.&text=this%20then%20means%20that%20when%20a%20specific%20pixel%20is%20being%20rendered%2C%20it%20is%20nearly%20random%20which%20one%20of%20the%20two%20primitives%20are%20drawn%20in%20that%20pixel]z-fighting[/url] that appears all throughout Clockwork Castle when using HPP's mesh [/size][size=2](needs new game)[/size][size=1][/size]
[size=1](Thankfully, Skyrim's rendering engine doesn't throw hissy fits when there's z-fighting. It just picks one and goes with it, thankfully. Thus, this is more of a small aesthetic change than a must-have like the Coals Fix)

[size=6][b]Sorting[/b][/size]
[size=2]Honestly one of my biggest reasons for creating this project.[/size][list][size=4][*][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924]Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul[/url] ([/b][color=#ffd966]Food[/color][b], [/b][color=#93c47d]Ingredients[/color][b])[/b]

[size=6][b]Translating[/b][/size]
[size=2]Since I work off of GitHub, you can easily submit a Pull Request with the appropriate translation files (which can easily be generated & edited in SSEEdit) & FOMOD translation (That's probably the hard part. I legitimately don't know how you'd go about that, but if FOMODs don't natively support it, you might try duplicating the step and adding conditions). If you don't think you can do it yourself, you can also translate everything and submit something like a text file with your translations[/size]
