## 3.0.0

### Patches

* New "Central Patch API" plugin that supports patching Clockwork's sorting automatically, without the need for messy `Game.GetFormFromFile()` calls.

### Bug Fixes

* Clockwork Bug Fixes
  * Fixed many different positioning issues
  * Dark Brotherhood cannot abduct you during the questline
    * Do note that they will be able to abduct you as soon as the questline completes
  * Fixed an annoying bug with parts of the castle disappearing when looking at them from certain positions at certain angles.
    * (Fixed by expanding the "Portals" about 1 unit into the walls)
  * Have some free FPS! Occlusion Panes are the best!
  * Added extra safeguards and failsafes to the Courier Counterspell script
    * Also added a trigger where the Courier spawns to catch them and teleport them back to their holding cell
* Clockwork Bug fixes by [DarthVitrial](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/5014137-darthvitrial/)
  * Remove property that was removed from `CLWDBAmClawMountActiScript` from the plugin as well (obliterate the log spam)
  * Removed 2 bad tint mappings
  * Gave the Shadow race "Advanced Avoidance" (a flag that makes the AI behave somewhat differently and should be applied to bipedal races, such as humanoids)
  * Implemented MANY mesh error fixes
* Changed the fix for Lahar not affecting the stealth meter to a scripted method, removing the need for an overwrite
  * Also applied to Lamashtu

### Superior Sorting

* Added Ingredients container to the Work Room
* Fixed steam showing up in the Ordinator accommodations before Steam Power is unlocked
* Added "Passed Lists," a form of cache to speed up sorting for items that have already been sorted into a particular container.

### Interesting Inhabitants

<!--
* FIXME: Added a script to all Wall Lean markers in the Castle, preventing Gilded from using the markers.
* TODO: Create multiple elaborate scenes for cooking and tending to children
-->
### Woodworker's Whim

#### Mount

* Clockwork's axe automatically mounts itself

#### System

* COMPLETELY REDONE! Rebuilt from THE GROUND UP!
* Split into a separate modâ€”don't worry, it'll still be bundled with Additional Clockwork, too :wink:
* Fast & Smooth
* Still supports all vanilla-compatible axes and still makes no modifications to the vanilla script

## **3.0.1**

* Bug Fixes: Fixed bug where reading Camilla's Note without first adding it to your inventory would now complete the objective to search the body for clues
* Superior Sorting: Fixed some issues with the auto-transferring items (e.g. Ingredients) - special care was taken so that this fix would work on existing saves
* Superior Sorting: Added Ingredient sorting to Work Room (part of those auto-transferring items)
* Woodworker's Whim: Now uses the correct scripts (it appears that it was using scripts from somewhere in the development cycle)

## **3.0.2**

* Fixed some incorrect paths in the FOMOD installer

## **3.0.3**

* Fixed an issue with the translation file name for the Work Room-only version of Woodworker's Whim
* Bug Fixes: Fixed an edge-case bug where, if you smuggled a follower into the castle, they could sit down and clip through Lamashtu's inactive body
* Superior Sorting: Fixed Soul Gems not being sorted

## **3.0.4**

* Fixed an issue in Woodworker's Whim which caused the Chopping Block script (`WWWResourceFurnitureAddon`) to enter an infinite activation loop under certain circumstances
