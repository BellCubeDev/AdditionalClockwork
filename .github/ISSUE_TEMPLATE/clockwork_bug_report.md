# **What Happened**
<!-- Describe what unexpected thing happened -->

## **Reproducing**
<!-- How can I make the big show up on my end? Example for a mis-aligned door:
1. Go to the Armoury
2. Look at the Secret Cabinet where it *should* connect to the wall
-->

# **Expected behavior**
<!-- What did you expect to happen? e.g. "I expected the Butter Churn to open the Hearthfire UI."
You can remove this if the issue is game-breaking (like a CTD) or obvious (e.g. the Issue title is "Crack in the Armoury secret door").
