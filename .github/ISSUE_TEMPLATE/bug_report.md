# **What Happened**
<!-- Describe what unexpected thing happened -->

## **Reproducing**
<!-- How can I make the big show up on my end? Example for a messed-up face after load:
1. Activate the button in the Main Hall
2. Save
3. Load the save
4. Look at Lahar's face
-->

# **Expected behavior**
<!-- What did you expect to happen? e.g. "I expected the Butter Churn to open the Hearthfire UI."
You can remove this if the issue is game-breaking (like a CTD) or obvious (e.g. the Issue title is "Crack in the Armoury secret door").
